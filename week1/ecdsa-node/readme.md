## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.

## Goal of the Project

The objective was to implement a verification mechanism utilizing Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures as a Public Key Cryptography technique, which enables the secure transfer of tokens without exposing the private key online.

### How it works

To begin, I added a script to test and generate users, and created three users with their private keys, public keys, and addresses. To view the list of users, run the following command: node server/scripts/users.js. Additionally, you will see a message and its corresponding signature.

The server now checks that the user is authorized to access the account by requiring both the user's address and a digital signature of a hardcoded message ("Hey, it's me."). The server then does the following:

Retrieves the corresponding public key of the provided address.
Retrieves the digital signature of the "Hey, it's me." message.
Verifies whether the digital signature was generated by the corresponding private key.
Grants access to the user's balance and allows them to transfer funds.
To use the project, provide the address of one of the three users and its corresponding signature to demonstrate ownership of the private key.
